Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number? ..http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/

Notes : 
Immutable object can contain mutable object . To ensure immutability of a data type that includes an instance variable of mutable type, we need to make local copy , known as 
defensive copy. None of the instance method changes the values ( no setters) .. All variables should be declared as final.

1) Immutable objects are by default thread safe, can be shared without synchronization in concurrent environment.
2) Immutable object simplifies development, because its easier to share between multiple threads without external synchronization.
3) Immutable object boost performance of Java application by reducing synchronization in code.

Disadvantage: Immutable object can create more garbage. Immutable object once created , can not be reused. So, each time new object is being created.
String should not be used to store password field. Instead use char [] ..not to remain in memory.

Disadvantages of Inheritance

1) First ,any change in superclass affects all subclasses. The subclass can not be developed independently of the superclass. fragile base class problem.
2) Second, the subclass code, having access to instance variables, can subvert the intention of the superclass code.

Right now , I am not actively looking. I narrowed down domain and companies that am looking forward to work. I strong feel that this company one of those. I decided kind of job am looking forward ..Security space, mobile and cloud computing .

------> Java Generics -->
Type Erasure : --At runtime the generic type is not available in general scenario. In generics T is just placeholder and type erasure will remove it during compilation.

Private nested class : Its instance variables can be directly accessed from within the enclosing class but no where else.
fail-fast iterator : Throw concurrent modification exception if the iteration is getting modified...
* ******** Analysis of algorithms  *********************
Constant: Executes fixed number of operation

Logarithmatic : Log N : Divide by 2 : Binary Search

Linear: Loop 

Linearithmatic : Nlog N : Divide and conquer --> Merge Sort

Quadratic : N2 

Cubic: N3 

Exponential: 2 power n : All sub sets

Two sum problem :   Can be solved by first doing sort
